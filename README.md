1. **Download the config.ini file:**
   Download the config.ini file that corresponds to your device's resolution. If you're unsure about your device's resolution, use an app called CPU-Z, available on the Google Play Store, to check this information.

2. **Locate the Citra User Data Folder:**
   After downloading, navigate to the Citra user data folder. Inside this folder, you'll find a subfolder named "/config."

3. **Replace the config.ini File:**
   Within the "/config" folder, replace the existing config.ini file with the new one you downloaded earlier.

4. **Completion:**
   The process is complete! Your Citra is now configured according to your device's resolution. Remember to restart Citra to apply the changes.

Always make a backup of the original config.ini file before replacing it, in case you want to restore the previous settings.

You need to set the custom_layout to true and modify the numeric values according to your resolution
